# Nextwork Website Hosting Project

A set up of a small website on Amazon S3 to understand how static hosting works in the cloud. My goal was to learn how S3 organises files, how access is controlled, and how a bucket becomes reachable on the internet.
A static website hosted on **Nextwork** and documented on Medium.
